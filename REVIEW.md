# SCrawler Incremental Review Ledger

Persistent state for the multi-session code review + hardening effort.
Any Claude session (any model) resumes from this file — read it fully before touching code.

## Ground rules

- **Fix confirmed bugs immediately**; build (`msbuild`), deploy to `D:\Utilities\SCrawler\`, commit per chunk.
- **Never speculatively edit** based on a suspicion — record it in *Open Suspicions* instead, and resolve it when the other half of the interaction is read.
- `BugReporterFormDiscordWebHook.vb` is gitignored (contains a Discord webhook secret) — never commit it. It's why `BugReporterForm` is a `Partial Class`.
- PersonalUtilities (`lib/*.dll`) is closed-source — cannot review; its known sharp edges are listed under *PersonalUtilities Hazards*.
- `SFile` is a **struct** — never use `Is`/`IsNot Nothing`; use `.IsEmptyString`.
- Git: `origin` = TomTheHand fork (push here), `upstream` = AAndyProgram.
- Use the PowerShell tool for git/msbuild, not Bash.

## Scope decisions (from user, 2026-07-07)

- Sites used: **Reddit + RedGIFs (top priority)**, Instagram, TikTok. All other site modules: **skip**.
- **Skip entirely**: SCrawler.YouTube subsystem (~12k lines), Automation, Groups/Channels, plugin projects, `My Project`/designer boilerplate.
- Feed: second-priority review — user finds it unresponsive/janky; goal is usability, not just bug-hunting.
- **Feature request**: live activity log — real-time visibility into what the app is doing
  ("User X completed → User Y: N posts, M new → downloading file 1 of M: remote → local").
  User delegated the design. Implement during chunks 1–2 while the download core is in context.

## Roadmap

| Chunk | Target | ~Lines | Status |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|
| 1 | `SCrawler\API\Base` + `API\BaseObjects` + `SCrawler\Download` core; start activity-log instrumentation | 8k | pending |
| 2 | Top-level `SCrawler\` (settings, MainFrame plumbing); finish activity-log UI | 6.7k | pending |
| 3 | `API\Reddit` + `API\Redgifs` + `API\Imgur` + `API\Gfycat` | 4.3k | pending |
| 4 | `API\Instagram` + `API\TikTok` | 3.8k | pending |
| 5 | `Download\Feed` — responsiveness/jank focus | 6.1k | pending |
| 6 | Ledger sweep: resolve all remaining Open Suspicions | — | pending |

## Reviewed

*(module → date → outcome; append as chunks complete)*

Pre-ledger work (earlier sessions, already committed to fork):
- `Download\NetworkBreaker.vb` — new DNS-failure circuit breaker (written by Claude, reviewed).
- `TDownloader.vb` — breaker integration + observability logging (partial review only; full review due in chunk 1).
- `API\Base\UserDataBase.vb` — `SafeGetResponse` added (partial review only; full review due in chunk 1).
- Site fixes applied: Reddit (ParseContainer ext fallback, MediaFromData guard), Instagram/Redgifs (SafeGetResponse), Mastodon/OnlyFans/ThreadsNet/Twitter (ReparseMissing existence probes + early-exit). These were targeted fixes, not full module reviews.

## Fixes applied

*(append per chunk: commit hash — summary)*

## Open Suspicions

*(one half of a cross-module interaction seen; verify when the other half is read)*

- `DownloadMissingOnly` mode skips `DownloadDataF`, leaving `UserExists` defaulted to `True` unless a module probes explicitly. Modules NOT yet audited for this: Reddit, Redgifs, Instagram, TikTok (the ones we actually use!). Check in chunks 3–4.
- The four prior ReparseMissing fixes (Mastodon/OnlyFans/ThreadsNet/Twitter) each hand-roll the existence-probe pattern — when reading `UserDataBase` in chunk 1, consider whether a shared base-class hook is safer.

## PersonalUtilities Hazards (closed-source, work around only)

- `Responser._ErrorProcessor` is left uninitialised → its own catch block throws NullReferenceException on HTTP-level errors. Workaround: `SafeGetResponse` in `UserDataBase.vb`.
- (append others as discovered)
